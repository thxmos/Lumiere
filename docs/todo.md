# TODOS:

## Roadmap

- get 10 users (the clear, hafta)
- metrics page

## Important For Launch

1. DESIGN for:

   - clicks,
   - image upload,
   - user create,
   - one time sign up flow

### Nice To Have

- cascading soft delete on user that saves all daata in a file
- soft delete (archive)links and be able to restore them / view stats / use for metrics

- DRYER Blob Image Upload implementation
  - used in product edit tab and avatar upload, make into a more reusable action
- sqids
  - not needed until products is ready
- better logging

  - not needed until app is prod ready

  - theme editor page that shows the current theme applied to your profile
  - seperate username page into seperate component

- Paginating API Results
  - Ensure APIs return only limited data at a time with pagination
  - not needed if enforcing the limits but could be good if theres ever a pro plan
